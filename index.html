                    <p>NYC is more than twice as populous as Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city. New York
                        City is at the southern tip of New York State and is situated on one of the world's largest
                        natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a
                        respective county. The five boroughs, which were created in 1898 when local governments were
                        consolidated into a single municipality, are: Brooklyn (Kings County), Queens (Queens County),
                        Manhattan (New York County), the Bronx (Bronx County), and Staten Island (Richmond County).[11]
                        New York City is a global city and a cultural, financial, high-tech,[12] entertainment, and
                        media center with a significant influence on commerce, health care and scientific output in life
                        sciences,[13][14] research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and
                        sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for
                        international diplomacy,[15][16] and it is sometimes described as the world's most important
                        city[17] and the capital of the world.[18][19]

                        The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the
                        New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and
                        urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million
                        in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous
                        megacities.[20] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration
                        to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[21] making it the most
                        linguistically diverse city in the world. New York City enforces a right-to-shelter law
                        guaranteeing shelter to anyone who needs shelter, regardless of their immigration status;[22]
                        and the city is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest
